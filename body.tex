\section{Introduction}

Tony Tyson has been contacted by Bill Gates with the idea to have some part of the DM technical stack named
after Jim Gray. As DM project manager and someone who worked with Jim on SDSS I think this is an excellent idea.  There was mention of some donation for this too but that is really icing - the fact the Gates would lik eot honor Jim Gray in some way through LSST is fitting and good. This document gives some ideas on the topic.

\section{Things to name}

We could look at our oft maligned product tree in DM for this. Under software we have :
\begin{itemize}
\item Batch Production
\item Database Back Bone
\item LSSST Science Platoform
\item Propmpt Processing
\item Science Pipelines
\item Quality Control
\end{itemize}


In terms of appropriatesness, Gray being one of the SQL founders, a database would be very appropriate.
