\textbf{Acronym} & \textbf{Description}  \\\hline

ADQL & Astronomical Data Query Language \\\hline
Alert & A packet of information for each source detected with signal-to-noise ratio > 5 in a difference image during Prompt Processing, containing measurement and characterization parameters based on the past 12 months of LSST observations plus small cutouts of the single-visit, template, and difference images, distributed via the internet \\\hline
Batch Production & Computational processing that is executed as inputs become available, in a distributed way across multiple enclaves when needed, while tracking status and outputs. Examples of Batch Production include offline processing for Prompt data products, calibration products, template images, and Special Programs data products. Prioritization protocols for the various types of batch production are given in LDM-148 \\\hline
Butler & A middleware component for persisting and retrieving image datasets (raw or processed), calibration reference data, and catalogs \\\hline
DB & DataBase \\\hline
DBB & Data Back Bone \\\hline
DM & Data Management \\\hline
DMLT & DM Leadership Team \\\hline
DMTN & DM Technical Note \\\hline
Data Release & The approximately annual reprocessing of all LSST data, and the installation of the resulting data products in the LSST Data Access Centers, which marks the start of the two-year proprietary period \\\hline
IBM & International Business Machines \\\hline
LSST & Large Synoptic Survey Telescope \\\hline
Prompt Processing & The processing that occurs at the Archive Center on the nightly stream of raw images coming from the telescope, including Difference Imaging Analysis, Alert Production, and the Moving Object Processing System. This processing generates Prompt Data Products \\\hline
QC & Quality Control \\\hline
Qserv & Proprietary Database built by SLAC for LSST \\\hline
Quality Control & Services and processes which are aimed at measuring and monitoring a system to verify and characterize its performance (as in LDM-522). Quality Control systems run autonomously, only notifying people when an anomaly has been detected. See also Quality Assurance \\\hline
SDSS & Sloan Digital Sky Survey \\\hline
SQL & Structured Query Language \\\hline
Science Pipelines & The library of software components and the algorithms and processing pipelines assembled from them that are being developed by DM to generate science-ready data products from LSST images. The Pipelines may be executed at scale as part of LSST Prompt or Data Release processing, or pieces of them may be used in a standalone mode or executed through the LSST Science Platform. The Science Pipelines are one component of the LSST Software Stack \\\hline
Science Platform & A set of integrated web applications and services deployed at the LSST Data Access Centers (DACs) through which the scientific community will access, visualize, and perform next-to-the-data analysis of the LSST data products \\\hline
background & In an image, the background consists of contributions from the sky (e.g., clouds or scattered moonlight), and from the telescope and camera optics, which must be distinguished from the astrophysical background. The sky and instrumental backgrounds are characterized and removed by the LSST processing software using a low-order spatial function whose coefficients are recorded in the image metadata \\\hline
metadata & General term for data about data, e.g., attributes of astronomical objects (e.g. images, sources, astroObjects, etc.) that are characteristics of the objects themselves, and facilitate the organization, preservation, and query of data sets. (E.g., a FITS header contains metadata) \\\hline
stack & a grouping, usually in layers (hence stack), of software packages and services to achieve a common goal. Often providing a higher level set of end user oriented services and tools \\\hline
